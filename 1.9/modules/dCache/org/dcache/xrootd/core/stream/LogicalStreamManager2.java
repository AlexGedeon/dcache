 * This class is just a quick hack to support current xrootd clients sending messages
 * asyncronously. It will just put possibly async xrootd messages into sequence by using
 * the queue of a single LogicalStream instance. Therefore this channel can only be used for
 * a single file session (open, io, close), which is the case in the mover. Attempting a
 * 2nd open on this channel will raise an TooMuchStreamsException.
