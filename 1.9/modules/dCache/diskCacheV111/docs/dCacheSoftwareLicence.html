<h2>Section 2 : Obligations for Distribution and Making 
Publicly Available</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li> If you distribute the Program or make it 
publicly available, be it in unmodified or 
modified form, be it in combination with other 
programs or in connection with hardware, you also 
have to provide or include the following:

<ol>
<li>all references to this License in the Source 
Code and/or Object Code;
</li>
<li>all references in the Source Code and/or 
Object Code containing information about the 
author of the Program;
</li>
<li>a conspicuous reference to this License and 
the Internet address <a href="http://www.dcache.org">www.dCache.ORG</a>, to 
be displayed in a form that can easily be read by 
the recipient;
</li>
<li>the complete text of this License in a form 
easy to perceive.
</li>
</ol>
<li> If license and/or contract terms are 
displayed when the Program is installed and/or 
started, the following items must also be 
displayed:
<ol>
<li>this License;</li>

<li>a reference to this License; and</li>

<li>a reference to the Licensor to the 
initial program components used under this 
License.</li>
</ol>
<li> You may not make the use of the Program 
contingent upon the compliance with conditions or 
obligations that are not set forth in this 
License. 

<li> Provided that you have received Documentation 
for the Program, you have to deliver this 
Documentation with the Program, as well, unless 
free delivery of the Documentation is not 
permitted by the documentation license.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--
            SECTION 3
-->
<h3>Section 3 : Further Obligations regarding the 
Distribution of Modified Versions</h3>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>You may only distribute modified versions of 
the Program or make them publicly available in 
accordance with the terms of this License, 
especially those in Section 1, par. 2, so that any 
third party is able to make use of the 
modified Program as a whole under this License. </li>

<li> If the Program or a part thereof is combined 
with another program, this also applies to the 
entire combination as a modified version of the 
Program, unless the other program is independent 
in terms of form and content.  Another program 
shall be regarded as independent if it fulfils 
the following requirements:

<ol>
<li> The Source Code of the combined programs must 
be contained in separate files which do not 
include components of the other part except for 
parts containing the information customary and 
required for the Program combination. The Source 
Code of the other program does not have to be 
delivered.</li>

<li>  The part which is combined with the Program 
must also be reasonably usable when not combined 
with the Program, i.e. on a standalone basis or 
with other programs. The meaning of "reasonably 
usable" will be based on the opinion of pertinent 
circles of expert groups in the relevant field. 
Such circles of experts include everyone who 
develops, uses, distributes or makes publicly 
available the Program concerned or programs with 
similar functionality.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you distribute the Program or make it 
publicly available in a modified form, you must 
include a reference to the modifications and the 
date of the modification in the Source Code. This 
reference must reveal which modifications were 
carried out and include existing references 
containing information on the author of the 
Program. This applies to whether or not you add 
your own copyright notice. Instead of a reference 
in the Source Code you may also use or carry on a 
version control system, provided this is also 
distributed or made publicly available.</li> 

<li>You may not charge any third party for the 
granting of the non-exclusive rights of use for 
the Program.</li>

<li>If you acquire any other intellectual or 
industrial property right to this Program apart 
from a copyright, in particular a patent or 
utility model, you license this intellectual or 
industrial property right for modified or 
unmodified versions of the Program to the extent 
that is necessary to make due use of the rights 
arising from this License. </li>
</blockquote>
<!--
            SECTION 4
-->

<h2>Section 4 : Further Obligations for the 
Distribution of the Object Code</h2>
<blockquote>

<ol>
<li>If you distribute the Program in Object Code 
form only, apart from the obligations defined in 
Sections 2 and 3, you have to either:

<ol>
<li>make the Complete Source Code publicly 
available in the Internet and - when distributing 
the Object Code - make a clear reference to the 
complete Internet address from which the Source 
Code can be downloaded; or

<li> distribute the Complete Source Code on a 
customary data carrier, taking into consideration 
Sections 2 and 3.
</ol>
</li>
<li>  If you make the Program publicly available in 
Object Code form, apart from the obligations 
defined in Sections 2 and 3 you must also make 
the Complete Source Code publicly available in 
the Internet and make a clear reference to the 
complete Internet address.</li>

<li>  Provided that you have received the 
Documentation for the Program, you have to 
deliver this Documentation together with the 
Program in accordance with Subsections 1 and 2, 
as well, unless free delivery of the 
Documentation is not permitted by the 
documentation license.</li>

</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2>Section 5 : Conclusion of the Contract</h2>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>With this License you and any other person 
are offered the conclusion of a contract for the 
use of this Program under the conditions of this 
License.

<li>You may use the Program in accordance with 
the applicable statutory provisions for the 
intended purpose without having to accept this 
License. In the European Union and in most other 
legal systems, this right in particular includes 
the following authorizations: 

<ol>
<li>Running of the Program as well as reproducing 
on hard-drive and RAM  required for this;

<li>Making of a back-up copy;

<li>Correcting errors;

<li>Distributing a lawfully acquired physical copy 
of the Program.
</ol>

<li>You declare your acceptance of this License 
by distributing the Program, making it publicly 
available, modifying or reproducing it in a way 
that goes beyond the intended use in the sense of 
Subsection 2. From this time on, this License 
shall be deemed as a legally binding agreement 
between the Licensor and you, without the 
need for the Licensor to obtain a 
declaration of acceptance.

<li>You and any other licensee acquire the rights 
arising from this License directly from the 
Licensor. Any sub-licensing or transfer 
of rights is not permitted.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<!--
            SECTION 6
-->

<h2>Section 6 Termination of Rights in the Event of 
Violations</h2>

<ol>
<li>Any violation of your obligations under this 
License automatically leads to the termination of 
your rights under this License and in addition to 
the termination of your rights to use the registered 
trade mark <strong>dCache&reg;</strong>

<li>Any rights of third parties having obtained 
the Program or rights to the Program from you 
shall remain unaffected. 
</ol>
<!--
            SECTION 7
-->

<h2>Section 7 : Disclaimer of Warranty and Liability</h2>

<ol>
<li>THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN <STRONG>AS IS</STRONG> BASIS. 
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
    THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
    IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR 
    OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, 
    OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OF THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE. 
    SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, LICENSEE ASSUMES THE COST OF ANY 
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OF CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN 
    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT 
    UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. THE LICENSOR HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, 
    UPDATES, ENHANCEMENTS, OR MODIFICATIONS.

<li>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE 
    FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 
    PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR 
    RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED 
    OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</ol>
<!--
            SECTION 8
-->

<h2>Section 8 : Agreements with Third Parties</h2>

<ol>
<li>This License only governs the relationship 
between you and the Licensor. It is not 
part of agreements between you and third parties. 

<li>This License does not limit your freedom to 
conclude agreements of any content whatsoever 
with third parties obtaining copies of the 
Program from you or purchasing services from you 
in connection with the Program, provided that you 
fulfil your obligations under this License and 
third-party rights under this License are not 
infringed. In particular, you may charge a fee as 
consideration for the transfer of the Program or 
other services.  

<li>This License does not commit you to forward 
the Program to a third party. You are free to 
decide to whom you wish to make the Program 
available. However, you may not prevent or 
complicate further use by third parties through 
the use of technical protective measures, in 
particular, the use of copy protection of any 
kind. Password-protected access restriction or 
use in an Intranet shall not be regarded as 
technical protective measures.
</ol>
<!--
            SECTION 9
-->

<h2>Section 9 Text of the License</h2>
<ol>
<li> This License is written in German and 
English. Both versions are equally binding. It is 
assumed that terminology used in the License has 
the same meaning in both versions. Should, 
however, differences arise, such meaning is 
authoritative which best brings into line both 
versions, taking into consideration the aim and 
purpose of the License. 

<li> The license board of the German Free Software 
License may put into force binding new versions 
of this License inasmuch as this is required and 
reasonable. New versions of the License will be 
published on the Internet site <http://www.d-
fsl.org> with a unique version number. The new 
version of the License becomes binding for you as 
soon as you become aware of its publication. 
Legal remedies against the modification of the 
License are not restricted by the regulations 
described above. 

<li> You may reproduce and distribute this License 
and make it publicly available in an unmodified 
form. 
</ol>
