dCache
======

__dCache__ is a system for storing and retrieving huge amounts of data,
distributed among a large number of heterogenous server nodes, under
a single virtual filesystem tree with a variety of standard access
methods. Depending on the Persistency Model, dCache provides methods
for exchanging data with backend (tertiary) Storage Systems as well
as space management, pool attraction, dataset replication, hot spot
determination and recovery from disk or node failures. Connected to
a tertiary storage system, the cache simulates unlimited direct
access storage space. Data exchanges to and from the underlying HSM
are performed automatically and invisibly to the user. Beside HEP
specific protocols, data in dCache can be accessed via __NFSv4.1
(pNFS)__, __FTP__ as well as through __WebDav__.
