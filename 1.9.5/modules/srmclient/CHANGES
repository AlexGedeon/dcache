Changed the client so that it does not try to change the state of 
failed file request. 
Please not that to build the srmcp client you now need to also copy 
the axis directory from dcache.

Started change log in CHANGES file!

The srmcp client switched from using the glue soap toolkit from "The 
Mind Electric" to Apache Axis soap toolkit. Now the srmcp will connect 
directly to the web service host, skipping the wsdl parsing step. As a
result, the srm urls corresponding to castor srm will now be different.
dcache srm urls will remain the same. The old way of connection to srm
service is still available and can be activated by option
"-connect_to_wsdl=true". New srm server is
available as well. 

Added the true support to the optional specification o the web service 
enpoint path specification in srm url. The  path part of srm url can now 
consist of two parts, path to the service, and path
to the file, separated by "?SFN=" part. For example in srm url
"srm://fnisd1:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/test", the web
service path is /srm/managerv1 and the file path is /pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/test
