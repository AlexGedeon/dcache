<h3>Sending a message to a wellknown cell</h3>
<blockquote>
To exchange messages, you need
<ul>
<li>the message, which can be any object which implements
    <em>java.io.Serializable</em>.
<li>the <em>dmg.cells.nucleus.CellPath</em> to the destination cell.
    The easiest way to construct the CellPath to the destination is
    <pre>
    CellPath path = new CellPath( "&lt;destinationCellName&gt;" ) ;
    </pre>
</ul>
A typical codelet to send an argument list to 
a server cell ( let's say 'anyServer' ) would look like :
<pre>
   CellPath path = new CellPath( "anyServer" ) ;
   
   Object [] argList = new Object[3] ;
   
   argList[0] = "set-request" ;
   argList[1] = "timeout" ;
   argList[2] = new Integer(2000) ;
   
   <strong>CellMessage message = new CellMessage( path , argList ) ;</strong>
   try{
      <strong>sendMessage( message ) ;</strong>
      say( "Message ID : "+message.getUOID() ) ;
   }catch( Exception e ){
      esay( "Got an exception : "+e ) ;
   }
</pre>
The <em>CellPath</em> 'path' is generated  and the message object 'argList'.
Both is combined to create the <em>CellMessage</em>.
The CellMessage is send by <em>sendMessage</em>.
There are mainly two types of exceptions which can occure.
<ul>
<li>The message object 'argList' or parts of it, is not 
    serializable. (NotSerializableException)
<li>The destination path doesn't exist or is not reachable.
    <a href=../api/dmg/cells/nucleus/NoRouteToCellException.html>
    dmg.cells.nucleus.NoRouteToCellException</a>.
</ul>
After the call to <em>sendMessage</em> the 'message' object
contains an UnifiedObjectIdentifier
<a href=../api/dmg/cells/nucleus/UOID.html>dmg.cells.nucleus.UOID</a>.
This <em>UOID</em> can be used to identify the answer which may expected
from the server.
</blockquote>
<h3>Receiving Messages</h3>
<blockquote>
The <em>CellAdapter</em> provides a member function with needs to
be overwritten to receive messages : 
<pre>
<strong>messageArrived( CellMessage message )</strong>
</pre>
The <em>messageArrived</em> method is called in a seprarated
thread. The argument is the
<a href=../api/dmg/cells/nucleus/CellMessage>
dmg.cells.nucleus.CellMessage
</a>.
The <em>CellMessage</em> can be inspected to get the
source path and the message object.
<pre>
public void messageArrived( CellMessage message ){

   CellPath  sourcePath = <strong>message.getSourcePath() ;</strong>
   Object    obj        = <strong>message.getMessageObject() ;</strong>
   Object [] array      = (Object []) obj ;
   String    reqType    = (String) array[0] ;
   say( "Request received from : "+sourcePath ) ;
   say( "Request type          : "+reqType ) ;

}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Replying a message</h3>
<blockquote>
In most cases, a server cell is not interested in the source of a
request it has to process. So the <em>CellMessage</em> provides 
mechanisms to easily return the answer to the sender.
Extending the example from above, the message object might
by changed.
<pre>
   array[0] = "set-answer" ;
   array[1] = "O.K." ;
   arrry[2] = null ;
</pre>
Because the <em>message.getMessageObject()</em> returns a reference
to the original message ( and not a copy ) a modification of <em>array</em>
changes the object which we need to send back.
<p>
The <em>message.setMessageObject</em> method allows to reply a 
totally different object.
<pre>
   Vector vec = new Vector() ;
   vec.add( "set-answer" ) ;
   vec.add( "O.K." ) ;
   <strong>message.setMessageObject( vec ) ; </strong>
</pre>
To actually send the message  back, the direction has to be
reverted first.
<pre>
   <strong>message.revertDirection() ;</strong>
   
   try{
   
      <strong>sendMessage( message ) ;</strong>
      
      say( "Message ID : "+message.getUOID() ) ;
   }catch( Exception e ){
      esay( "Got an exception : "+e ) ;
   }

    
}
</pre>
A new <em>UOID</em> is assigned to the message, but the
original <em>UOID</em> can be obtained by the new destination,
the former source, by calling the <em>message.getLastUOID()</em>
method.
</blockquote>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote>
The <a href=tutorial-sendMsg-e.html>XchangeMessage.java</a> example
can be started as client or as server, depending on the number of arguments. 
Without arguments it's a server. Providing one or more arguments
lets it become a client. The first argument is the
destination, which is the name of the serverCell and the second, optional 
argument is the number of seconds between two requests.
In addition the example code shows how to use arguments when starting
a cell.
Copy the code into a file named XchangeMessage.java, compile
it and run it within the standard domain as described in 
<a href=tutorial-firstCell.html>My First Cell</a>.
Log into the domain and start a server and two clients.
<pre>
create XchangeMessage pingServer
create XchangeMessage clientA   pingServer
create XchangeMesssge clientB  "pingServer  4"
</pre>
Try to find out what happens if you kill the
<em>PingServer</em>.<p>
Because a client is as well a server, you may create a chain of
ping cells.
<pre>
create XchangeMessage serverOnly
create XchangeMessage clientServer  serverOnly
create XchangeMessage clientOnly    clientServer
</pre>
