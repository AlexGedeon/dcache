    <!-- RFC 2253 describes how LDAP DNs should escape certain
         characters.  Unfortunately, BDII is not RFC 2253 compliant;
         including a escape-required character in the attribute value
         that is to become part of an object's DN results in BDII
         alternatively publishing and suppressing publication of that
         object.  This is described in bug:

         https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?57840

         Currently, this problem is only manifest for the GlueSA
         objects used to provide information on installed capacity:
         the NAS auto-generated names can include a comma if the set
         of pools is shared between two or more store units.

         Here we introduce a work-around: we map all must-escape
	 characters ( ',', '+', '"', '\', '<', '>', '=', ';') to the
	 colon character. -->
