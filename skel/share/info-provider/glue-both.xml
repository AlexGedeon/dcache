    |   This file defines how an XML file is converted into LDAP,
    |   specifically, how the XML file that describes dCache's current state
    |   is converted into LDAP suitable for Glue v1.3.
    |
    |   Some of the information that Glue requires is independent of dCache;
    |   for example, the site's "Unique ID" is something that a dCache
    |   instance doesn't know.  For this reason, you must configure this
    |   file to include that information.
    |
    |   The general format of this file is described in:
    |
    |       ${ourHomeDir}/share/doc/xylophone/Guide.txt
    |
    |   That document describes the semantics of the XML elements in this
    |   file.  However, the layout of this file is designed so you shouldn't
    |   have to refer to that guide.  Simply edit the configuration as
    |   described in the comment immediately above.
    |
    |   A word of causion: be careful when using characters that are special
    |   in XML.  If you wish to use the less-than (<) or the ampersand (&)
    |   symbols, be sure to write them as &lt; and &amp; respectively.
