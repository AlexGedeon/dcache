How to configure and test dCache GLUE info provider
----

This document describes how to configure the information provider
supplied with dCache so it provides the correct information for WLCG.
This is necessary so that WLCG infrastructure (such as FTS) and
clients using WLCG tools can correctly use the dCache instance.

The process is designed to be the minimum overhead so it can easily be
performed manually; however, you may choose to use an automatic
configuration tool, such as yaim.



Ensuring dCache information is available
----

Make sure that both the httpd and info services are running, both are
required for publishing information.  By default, the info service is
started on the admin node; but it is possible to configure dCache so
it runs on a different node.  You should run only one info service per
dCache instance.

  NB the info service is different from, and completely independent
     of, the infoProvider service.

If necessary, you may start the info service manually:

  /opt/d-cache/bin/dcache start info

You can check which services are running on the local node using the
status command:

  /opt/d-cache/bin/dcache status

You can also verify both services (httpd and info) are running with
the following wget command.  This command assumes that you run it on
the node that has the httpd service (by default, the admin node).  If
may run the command on any node by replacing "localhost" with the
hostname of the node running the httpd service.

  wget -O/dev/null http://localhost:2288/info

If you see the following output:

  # wget -O/dev/null http://localhost:2288/info
  --10:05:35--  http://localhost:2288/info
             => `/dev/null'
  Resolving localhost... 127.0.0.1
  Connecting to localhost|127.0.0.1|:2288... failed: Connection refused.

Then the httpd service is not running.  Start the service with the
following command:

  /opt/d-cache/bin/dcache httpd start

If you see the following output:

  # wget -O/dev/null http://localhost:2288/info
  --10:03:13--  http://localhost:2288/info
             => `/dev/null'
  Resolving localhost... 127.0.0.1
  Connecting to localhost|127.0.0.1|:2288... connected.
  HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 503 Unable to contact the info cell.  Please ensure the info cell is running.
  10:03:13 ERROR 503: Unable to contact the info cell.  Please ensure the info cell is running..

Then the info service is not running.  start it with the following
command:

  /opt/d-cache/bin/dcache info start



Configuring info provider
----

In the directory /opt/d-cache/etc you will find a template file
glue-1.3.xml.template.  Copy this file as glue-1.3.xml in the same
directory.

Edit glue-1.3.xml with your favourite text editor.

The file is split into two parts.  The first part contains the
configuration that a site will typically need to configure.  Most
sites may leave the second part alone.  The two parts are separated by
the comment:

    YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TO EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS POINT.

Take care when editing the file!  The file must be valid,
well-formed XML.  In particular, be very careful if you add a
less-than symbol ('<') that isn't part of an XML element, or an
ampersand symbol ('&') that isn't part of an entity markup; if you
wish to add these symbol you must use the marked-up version: "&lt;"
and "&amp;" respectively.  For example:

    <constant id="SE-NAME">Simple &amp; small dCache instance for small VOs (typically &lt; 20 users)</constant>

As a hint, you should *only* edit text between two elements or add
more elements (for lists and mappings).  You should *never* edit text
inside double-quote marks.  For example, with the following element
definition:

    <constant id="SITE-UNIQUE-ID">EXAMPLESITE-ID</constant>

you should review the contents between the elements ("EXAMPLESITE-ID")
and edit the contents accordingly.  You should *never* edit the
"SITE-UNIQUE-ID" as it is in double-quote marks.  A valid, edited
value is:

    <constant id="SITE-UNIQUE-ID">DESY-HH</constant>



Testing the info provider
----

Once you have configured glue-1.3.xml to reflect your site's
configuration, you may test that the info provider produces meaningful
results.

Run the script:

  /opt/d-cache/libexec/infoProvider/info-based-infoProvider.sh

This should provide GLUE data in LDIF format, which should look like:

  #
  #  LDIF generated by Xylophone v0.1
  #
  #  XSLT processing using libxslt 1.0 (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/)
  #
  
  
  dn: GlueSEUniqueID=dcache-srm.example.org,mds-vo-name=resource,o=grid
  objectClass: GlueSETop
  objectClass: GlueSE
  objectClass: GlueKey
  objectClass: GlueSchemaVersion
  GlueSEStatus: Production
  GlueSEUniqueID: dcache-srm.example.org
  GlueSEArchitecture: multidisk
  GlueSEImplementationName: dcache
  [... etc ...]

The actual values you see will be site-specific and depend on the
contents of the glue-1.3.xml file and your dCache configuration.

To verify that there are no problems, redirect stdout to /dev/null to
show only the error messages

  /opt/d-cache/libexec/infoProvider/info-based-infoProvider.sh >/dev/null
  
If you see two error messages, repeated several times:

  error : Operation in progress
  warning: failed to load external entity "http://localhost:2288/info"

then verify that the httpd service is running, using the above wget
test and also by running:

  /opt/d-cache/bin/dcache status

If you see the single error messages, repeated several times:

  warning: failed to load external entity "http://localhost:2288/info"

then verify that the info service is running.



Configuring BDII
----

By default BDII obtains fresh information by querying GIP.  To allow
BDII to obtain the GLUE information, you must tell GIP where to find
this information.  This is achieved by either copying the above script
into the directory /opt/glite/etc/gip/provider/

  cp /opt/d-cache/libexec/infoProvider/info-based-infoProvider.sh /opt/glite/etc/gip/provider/

or by symbolically linking the script in there:

  ln -s /opt/d-cache/libexec/infoProvider/info-based-infoProvider.sh /opt/glite/etc/gip/provider/

If GIP (glite-info-generic) and BDII are installed, and the BDII
daemons are running, then you will see the information appear in BDII
after a short delay (a minute or so).

You can verify the information is present with the query:

  ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://localhost:2170 -b o=grid

This should give similar results to running the information provider
script manually.



Updating information
----

The information contained within the info service may take a short
time to achieve a complete overview of dCache's state.  For certain
gathered information it may take a few minutes before the information
stabilises.  This is intentional and prevents the gathering of
information from adversely affecting dCache's performance.

The information contained within the LDAP (a.k.a. "BDII") server is
updated periodically from the information contained in the info
service.  By default this is every 60 seconds.  This will introduce an
additional delay between a change in dCache's state and that
information propagating.

A few pieces of information are "hard-coded" within the glue-1.3.xml
file; that is, you will need to edit this file before the published
value(s) will change.  These values are ones that typically a
site-admin must choose independently of dCache's current operations.
