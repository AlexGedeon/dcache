#     Default values for gPlazma configuration
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   This Java properties file contains default values for gPlazma
#   configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
#   etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes
#   will be lost when you next upgrade.



#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Common properties
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  gPlazma comes in two versions: the one available before 1.9.12
#  (gPlazma-1) and the new gPlazma (gPlazma-2).  This section contains
#  options that apply equally to gPlazma-1 or gPlazma-2.
#

#  ---- The gPlazma version to run
#
#  Valid values are "1" and "2".  Selecting "1" chooses gPlazma-1, the
#  implementation of gPlazma available in dCache versions prior to
#  1.9.12.  Selecting "2" chooses the new gPlazma.
#
gplazma.version = 1


#  ---- Name of the gPlazma cell
#
#  The name gPlazma will use when running.  This name will be
#  registered as well-known to other services.  This is important if
#  you wish to run multiple gPlazma cells as they will need different
#  names.
#
gplazma/cell.name=gPlazma


#  ---- Name used by doors
#
#  The name of the gPlazma cell a door will contact.  This becomes
#  important when you have multiple gPlazma instances in a dCache
#  system with different doors talking to different gPlazma cells.
#
gplazma=gPlazma


#  ---- Number of concurrent requests to process.
#
#  The number of login requests that gPlazma will process
#  concurrently.  Setting this number too high may result in large
#  spikes of CPU activity and the potential to run out of memory.
#  Setting the numebr too lower results in potentially slow login
#  activity.
#
gPlazmaNumberOfSimutaneousRequests=30


#  ---- Use gPlazma as a module
#
#  This property takes one of two values: false or true.  Specifying
#  false has no effect.  Enabling gPlazma as a module results in doors
#  running their own gPlazma.  This has the advantage of distributing
#  the CPU load but requires additional maintenance.  dCache as a
#  module may be enabled on a per-door basis.
#
useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=false


#  ---- Run a centralised gPlazma service
#
#  This property takes one of two values; false or true.  Specifying
#  true if dCache is to run a single centralised gPlazma.  Doors may
#  still be configured to use gPlazma module.
#
useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell=true



#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Properties for gPlazma-1
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  The following properties are for gPlazma-1, the version of gPlazma
#  available in versions of dCache prior to 1.9.12
#

#  ---- Location of the policy file
#
#  The policy file provides overall control of how gPlazma behaves.
#  It specifies which plugins are to be used, the plugins' relative
#  priorities and also how these plugins behave.
#
gplazmaPolicy=${dcache.paths.etc}/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy



#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Properties for gPlazma-2
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  The following properties are for the version of gPlazma
#  available with 1.9.12 and later.
#

#  ---- Location of the configuration file
#
#  The location of the gPlazma configuration file.  This controls
#  which plugins are used to authenticate end-users, in which order
#  and how the plugins are configured.
#
gplazma.configuration.file=${dcache.paths.etc}/gplazma.conf


#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Obsolete properties.
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#  The following properties are no longer supported and have no
#  effect.
#
(obsolete)gPlazmaRequestTimeout=180
(obsolete)delegateToGPlazma=false
