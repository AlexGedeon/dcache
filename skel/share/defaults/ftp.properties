#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#     Default values for FTP doors
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   This Java properties file contains default values for FTP
#   configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
#   etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes
#   will be lost when you next upgrade.

#  ---- Period between successive GridFTP performance markers
#
#   This variable controls how often performance markers are written.
#   The value is in seconds: set performanceMarkerPeriod to 180 to
#   get performanceMarkers every 3 minutes.  A value of 0 will
#   disable performance markers.
#
performanceMarkerPeriod=70

#  ---- PoolManager timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   PoolManager cell.
#
gsiftpPoolManagerTimeout=5400

#  ---- Pool timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   pool cells.
#
gsiftpPoolTimeout=600

#  ---- PnfsManager timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   PnfsManager cell.
#
gsiftpPnfsTimeout=300

#  ---- How many times to retry pool selection
#
#   If pool selection fails for some reason, the door may retry the
#   operation. This setting specifies how many times to retry before
#   the transfer fails.
#
gsiftpMaxRetries=80

#  ---- Maximum number of concurrent streams to allow
#
#   If a client creates more concurrent streams than allowed, the
#   transfer will fail.
#
gsiftpMaxStreamsPerClient=10

#  ---- Number of concurrent streams to use by default
#
#   Default number of streams per client in mode E transfers. For
#   compliance with GFD.21, this has to be 1. Therefore this property
#   is deprecated.
#
(deprecated)gsiftpDefaultStreamsPerClient=1

#  ---- Limit on number of concurrent logins
#
#   When set to true, FTP doors delete files after upload failures.
#
gsiftpDeleteOnConnectionClosed=true

#  ---- Limit on number of concurrent logins
#
#   Specifies the largest number of simulatenous logins to allow to an
#   FTP door.
#
gsiftpMaxLogin=100

#  ---- Mover queue
#
#   The mover queue on the pool to which FTP transfers will be
#   scheduled. If blank, the default queue will be used.
#
gsiftpIoQueue=

#  ---- What IP address to use for connections from pools to the FTP door
#
#   FTP doors in some cases act as proxies for the transfer. This
#   property specifies the IP of the interface on the door that the
#   pool will connect to. If empty, the door will choose a local
#   address. This address must not be a wildcard address.
#
gsiftpAdapterInternalInterface=

#  ----- FTP transaction log directory
#
#   When set, a log file per FTP session is created in this directory.
#
FtpTLogDir=

#  ---- Whether passive GridFTP transfers are allowed.
#
#   This option defines whether a pool should accept incoming
#   connections for GridFTP transfers.
#
#   Valid values are:
#       'true'
#       'false'
#   The default is:
#       'false' for FTP doors
#       'true' for pools
#
#   If this variable is set to true, pools are allowed accept
#   incoming connections for GridFTP transfers.  This only affects
#   passive transfers.  Only passive transfers using GFD.47 GETPUT
#   (aka GridFTP 2) can be redirected to the pool.  Other passive
#   transfers will be channelled through a proxy component at the FTP
#   door. If this variable is set to false, all passive transfers to
#   through a proxy.
#
#   This setting is interpreted by both FTP doors and pools, with
#   different defaults. If set to true at the door, then the setting
#   at the individual pool will be used.
#
gsiftpAllowPassivePool=false
