#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#     Default values for FTP doors
#  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   This Java properties file contains default values for FTP
#   configuration parameters. All values can be redefined in
#   etc/dcache.conf. Do not modify any values here as your changes
#   will be lost when you next upgrade.

#  ---- Period between successive GridFTP performance markers
#
#   This variable controls how often performance markers are written.
#   The value is in seconds: set performanceMarkerPeriod to 180 to
#   get performanceMarkers every 3 minutes.  A value of 0 will
#   disable performance markers.
#
performanceMarkerPeriod=70

#  ---- PoolManager to use for FTP doors
#
#   When empty a PoolManager is determined automatically based on
#   other configuration parameters.
gsiftpPoolManager=

#  ---- Pool proxy to use for FTP doors
#
#   A cell through which all pool communication is routed.  When empty
#   a pool proxy is determined automatically based on other
#   configuration parameters.
#
gsiftpPoolProxy=

#  ---- PoolManager timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   PoolManager cell.
#
gsiftpPoolManagerTimeout=5400

#  ---- Pool timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   pool cells.
#
gsiftpPoolTimeout=600

#  ---- PnfsManager timeout
#
#   Specifies the timeout in milliseconds for communication with the
#   PnfsManager cell.
#
gsiftpPnfsTimeout=300

#  ---- How many times to retry pool selection
#
#   If pool selection fails for some reason, the door may retry the
#   operation. This setting specifies how many times to retry before
#   the transfer fails.
#
gsiftpMaxRetries=80

#  ---- Maximum number of concurrent streams to allow
#
#   If a client creates more concurrent streams than allowed, the
#   transfer will fail.
#
gsiftpMaxStreamsPerClient=10

#  ---- Number of concurrent streams to use by default
#
#   Default number of streams per client in mode E transfers. For
#   compliance with GFD.21, this has to be 1. Therefore this property
#   is deprecated.
#
(deprecated)gsiftpDefaultStreamsPerClient=1

#  ---- Whether to delete files after upload failures
#
#   When set to true, FTP doors delete files after upload failures.
#
gsiftpDeleteOnConnectionClosed=true

#  ---- Limit on number of concurrent logins
#
#   Specifies the largest number of simulatenous logins to allow to an
#   FTP door.
#
gsiftpMaxLogin=100

#  ---- Mover queue
#
#   The mover queue on the pool to which FTP transfers will be
#   scheduled. If blank, the default queue will be used.
#
gsiftpIoQueue=

#  ---- What IP address to use for connections from pools to the FTP door
#
#   FTP doors in some cases act as proxies for the transfer. This
#   property specifies the IP of the interface on the door that the
#   pool will connect to. If empty, the door will choose a local
#   address. This address must not be a wildcard address.
#
gsiftpAdapterInternalInterface=

#  ----- FTP transaction log directory
#
#   When set, a log file per FTP session is created in this directory.
#
FtpTLogDir=

#  ---- Whether passive FTP transfers are relayed by the door
#
#   Passive FTP transfers are those where the client creates the data
#   channel connection to the server.
#
#   If this option is set to true, then all passive transfers are
#   relayed by the FTP door. If this option is set to false, then the
#   client is instructed to connect directly to the pool. This
#   requires that the pool allows inbound connections. Even when set
#   to false, there are several circumstances in which the connection
#   cannot be established directly to the pool due to limitations in
#   the FTP protocol. In such cases the connection will be relayed by
#   the door.
#
#   This setting is interpreted by both FTP doors and pools. For a
#   given combination of door and pool, a direct connection to the
#   pool can only be established if this setting is false at both the
#   door and the pool.
#
ftp.proxy.on-passive=false

#  ---- Whether active FTP transfers are relayed by the door
#
#   Active FTP transfers are those where the server creates the data
#   channel connection to the client.
#
#   If this option is set to true, then all active transfers are
#   relayed by the FTP door. If this option is set to false, then the
#   pool connects directly to the client. This requires that the pool
#   allows outbound connections.
#
ftp.proxy.on-active=false

#  ---- Obsolete properties
#
(obsolete)ftpBase=
(obsolete)spaceReservation=
(obsolete)spaceReservationStrict=
(forbidden)gsiftpAllowPassivePool=Use ftp.proxy.on-passive instead of gsiftpAllowPassivePool
