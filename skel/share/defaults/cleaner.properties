#
#  The cleaner is the component that watches for files being deleted
#  in the namespace.  There must be at most one cleaner per dCache
#  instance.  When files are deleted, the cleaner will notify the
#  pools that hold a copy of the deleted files' data and tell the
#  pools to remove that data.  Optionally, the cleaner can instruct
#  HSM-attached pools to remove copies of the file's data stored on
#  tape.
#
#  The cleaner runs periodically, so there may be a delay between a
#  file being deleted in the namespace and the corresponding deletion
#  of that file's data in pools and on tape.
#
#  The cleaner maintains a list of pools that it was unable to
#  contact: pools are either offline or sufficiently overloaded that
#  they couldn't respond in time.  The cleaner will periodically try
#  to delete data on pools in this list but, between such retries,
#  these pools are excluded from cleaner activity.

#  ---- Maximum files in one message
#
#  For each pool, the cleaner produces a list of all deleted files
#  that have data stored on that pool.  When instructing a pool to
#  remove data, the cleaner includes as many files as possible in the
#  message.
#
#  The cleaner.limits.batch-size property places an upper limit on the
#  number of files' data to be deleted in a message.  If more than
#  this number of files are to be deleted then the pool will receive
#  multiple messages.

#  ---- HSM cleaner enabled
#
#  If enabled then the cleaner will instruct an HSM-attached pool to
#  remove a deleted files' data stored in the HSM.

#  To enable this feature, the property must be enabled at all the
#  pools that are supposed to delete files from an HSM.
#

#  ---- HSM cleaner maximum requests
#
#  As with messages send to pools to remove deleted files' data stored
#  on the pool, the cleaner will group together multiple deleted files
#  that had data stored on the HSM and that may be deleted by the same
#  pool.  The cleaner.limits.hsm-batch-size property places an upper
#  limit on the number of files a message may contain.
#
cleaner.limits.hsm-batch-size = 100

#  ---- HSM-deleting message communication timeout
#
#  Files are cleaned from an HSM by the cleaner sending a message to
#  an HSM-attached pool.  The pool replies with a confirmation
#  message.  This property specifies the timeout the cleaner adopts
#  while waiting for the reply after which the operation is considered
#  to have failed.
