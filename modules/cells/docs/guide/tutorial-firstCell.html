<h1>Creating a cell class</h1>
<h4>The Constructor</h4>
<blockquote>
   The easiest way to create a cell class is to
   <em>extend</em> an arbitrary class by 
   <a href=../api/dmg/cells/nucleus/CellAdapter.html>
   dmg.cells.nucleus.CellAdapter </a>. 
   The constructor of <em>CellAdapter</em> needs at least the
   name of the cell which you want to create.
   <pre>
      import dmg.cells.nucleus.* ;

      public class FooCell <strong>extends CellAdapter</strong> {
          
          public FooCell( String name ){

             <strong>super( name )</strong>

             ...
             
             say( "Cell "+getCellName()+" created." ) ;

          }
      }
   </pre>
   The CellAdapter tries to create the cell with the specified name.
   If the name is already in use by another cell, 
   the constructor throws an <em>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</em> with 
   the message "Name Mismatch".
   If the name of the cell is not significant, an '*' can be used as 
   last character in the cells name. The CellAdapter will find a unique
   name then. The <strong>getCellName()</strong> method will return the chosen name.
   The <strong>say</strong> method typically will send its argument to
   <em>System.out.println</em> but may configured differently.
   So 
   <pre>
       CellAdapter cell1 = new FooCell( "foo*" ) 
       CellAdapter cell2 = new FooCell( "foo*" ) 
   </pre>
   may print 
   <pre>
       Cell foo-0022 created.
       Cell foo-0023 created.
   </pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Activating a cell</h4>
<blockquote>
   Cell Objects can only be created ( new FooCell ) within a 
   <em>Domain Environment</em>. A virtual machine creates a <em>Domain Environment</em>
   as soon as a <em>dmg.cells.nucleus.SystemCell</em> object has been
   created.
   <pre>
       SystemCell system = new SystemCell( "&lt;domainName&gt;" ) ;
   </pre>
   &lt;domainName&gt; is the name of this <em>Domain Environment</em>. As long as
   no Domains are connect to each other, the name is not
   significant. The name of the <em>SystemCell</em> will always be <em>System</em>.
   Only on <em>SystemCell</em> can be created within a <em>Domain</em>.
   <pre>
       SystemCell system = new SystemCell( "MyFirstDomain" ) ;
       new FooCell( "myFirstCell" ) ;
       new FooCell( "foo*" ) ;
       new FooCell( "foo*" ) ;
   </pre>
   The above codelet will create a <em>Domain Environment</em> with the name
   <em>MyFirstDomain</em> and four cells called
   <em>System, myFirstCell, foo-001, foo-002</em>.
</blockquote>
<h4>Running a Domain</h4>
<blockquote>
   The <strong>dmg.cells.services</strong> contains the code of 
   a standard <strong>Domain</strong> with is configurable by
   command line options.
   <a href=../api/dmg/cells/services/Domain.html>dmg.cells.services.Domain</a>
   allows you to create and remove <em>Cells</em> dynamically and to
   inspect the Cell Environment by login into it with by telnet.
   <br><strong>NOTE : </strong>To enable the dynamic creation of cells
   the constructor of the cell class has to have <strong>two</strong> String arguments.
   <pre>
       public FooCell( String name , String args ){
           super( name ) ;
       }
   </pre>
   <ul>
   <li>Create a file FooCell.java with the example cell above.
   <li>make sure your current working directory and the 
       cells.jar file is in your <em>CLASSPATH</em>.
   <li>compile it 'javac FooCell.java'
   <li>start the standard domain which listens to telnet port &lt;nnn&gt;.
   <pre>
        java dmg.cells.services.Domain TestDomain -telnet &lt;nnn&gt;
   </pre>
   <li>telnet into the domain 
   <pre>
        telnet localhost &lt;nnn&gt;
   </pre>
   </ul>
   You may choose any name as your username. The password has to be <strong>elch</strong>.
   You will be prompted by 
   <pre>
   <strong>tn-&lt;yourUserName&gt;-100 &gt;</strong>
   </pre>
   The shell your are logged into, provides a small set of 
   commands to manipulate and inspect the <em>Domain Environment</em>.
   A simple help is available throu the <em>help</em> command.
   <br>
   For a list of all cells use the <strong>ps -a</strong> command.
   <pre>
    <strong>tn-patrick-100 &gt;</strong> ps -a
      Cell List
    ------------------
    tlm            Active    0   TelnetLoginManager  P=22123;C=dmg.cells.services.StreamLoginCell
    System         Active    0   SystemCell          TestDomain:R=0;A=0;F=0;R=0;X=0
    tn-patrick-100 Active    0   StreamLoginCell     patrick@localhost/127.0.0.1
    <strong>tn-patrick-100 &gt;</strong> 
   </pre>
   The output list the name of the cell, the current status, the number of messages
   queued for this cell, the class name and a short discription of the cell
   itself. The description is the result of the <em>toString</em> method of
   the perticular cell object.
   <br>
   To get more information about a cell you may use
   <pre>
   <strong>tn-patrick-100 &gt;</strong> ps &lt;cellName&gt;
   </pre>
   This command executes the <em>getInfo()</em> method of a cell.
   The <em>toString()</em> and <em>getInfo()</em> methods need to
   be overwritten by the cell implementation to get
   object specific information.
   <br>
   To activate an instance of your FooCell run :
   <pre>
   <strong>tn-patrick-100 &gt;</strong> create FooCell fooCellName
   created : fooCellName
   </pre>
   Check the creation of the new FooCell instance with 'ps -a'.
   <p>
   To remove the cell from the cell list, use the
   <pre>
   <strong>tn-patrick-100 &gt;</strong> kill &lt;cellName&gt;
   </pre>
   command.<p>
   <strong>Killing the <em>SystemCell</em> will start the domain shutdown
   sequence.</strong> First all cells except the <em>System</em> cell
   are killed and finally the <em>System.exit(0)</em> is called.
   <p>
   The <em>exit command</em> leaves the shell and jumps into
   a kind of micro shell, the <strong>.. shell</strong>.
   Another <em>exit command</em>  quits the
   telnet connection. The <em>micro shell</em> can connect the
   telnet session to an arbitrary cell.
   <pre>
   <strong>.. &gt;</strong> set dest &lt;cellName&gt;
   <strong>&lt;cellName&gt; &gt;</strong> 
   </pre>
   After issuing this command, all lines, typed in, are send
   to &lt;cellName&gt; and the respond is displayed by the
   telnet session.
   <em>exit</em> will return to the <em>.. shell</em> and
   <pre>
   <strong>.. &gt;</strong> set dest &lt;cellName&gt;
   <strong>&lt;cellName&gt; &gt;</strong> 
   </pre>
   <pre>
   <strong>.. &gt;</strong> set dest local
   </pre>
   returns to the standard <em>cell shell</em>.

<h4>Killing cells</h4>
<blockquote>
   There are a set of possibilities to kill a cell.
   <ul>
   <li>The cell uses the <em>kill()</em> method to kill itself.
   <li>A cell uses the <em>kill( String cellName )</em> to kill anothercell.
   <li>A cell is killed by the 'telnet shell'
   </ul>
   As soon as one of the kill commands is executed :
   <ul>
   <li>the perticular cell is scheduled for killing
   <li>the kill command returns asynchronously
   <li>the name of the cell is taken out of the
       cell list. ( no new messages can be send to this cell)
   <li>the cell goes into 'removal' status ( ps -a )
   
   <li>the <em>cleanUp()</em> method of the
       cell, which is going to be killed, is called.
   <li>as long as this method doesn't return, the current 
       status doesn't change. The method is called within
       a private thread. So no other services have to wait
       for the method to return.
   <li>as soon as the method returns, the cell will be totally 
       removed.
   </ul>
   Its up to the creator of the cell class to overwrite the
   <em>cleanUp</em> method to perform any necessary clean up activities.

<h4>Full First Cell Example</h4>
The first <a href=tutorial-firstCell-e.html>example</a> summarizes
everything discussed in this chapter.
The java file has to be called 'FooCell.java'. You can run it exactly as
described above with the standard Domain Environment.
After starting the cell it will live for 20 seconds and then it will
call <em>kill</em> itself. The <em>cleanUp</em> call will 
sleep for 2 seconds before it returns, to simulate a complicated 
cleanup sequence.
