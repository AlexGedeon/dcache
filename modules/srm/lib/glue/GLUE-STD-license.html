        <ul>
          <li>You are not bundling GLUE Standard or a derivative of it as part 
            of a software development environment such as JBuilder, WebGain or 
            VisualAge. Note that this restriction is targeted at IDE vendors, 
            and does not prevent developers from loading GLUE Standard into an

            restriction is targeted at software infrastructure vendors, and does 
            not prevent developers from using and bundling GLUE Standard with 
            applications that run on these platforms.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
