1) Upgrade the GIP:

	rpm -Uvh lcg-info-generic-1.0.22-1.noarch.rpm

2) Copy GIP plugin and provider software for dCache:

	cp <somewhere>/infoDynamicSE.jar      /opt/lcg/libexec
	cp <somewhere>/infoDynamicSE-plugin   /opt/lcg/libexec
	cp <somewhere>/infoDynamicSE-provider /opt/lcg/libexec

3) To continue to use MDS system already installed and configured, modify
   /opt/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-wrapper. 
   Its content must be:

 	#!/bin/sh
	export LANG=C
	/opt/lcg/bin/lcg-info-generic /opt/lcg/etc/lcg-info-generic.conf

4) A main ldif static file for SE have to be put in /opt/lcg/var/gip/ldif .
   We can reuse the old lcg-info-static.ldif that contains all information.

	cp /opt/lcg/var/gip/lcg-info-static.ldif /opt/lcg/var/gip/ldif/lcg-info-static-SE.ldif

5) Finally we have to enable our plugin and provider creating a link in gip directories.

	ln -s /opt/lcg/libexec/infoDynamicSE-plugin   /opt/lcg/var/gip/plugin/
 	ln -s /opt/lcg/libexec/infoDynamicSE-provider /opt/lcg/var/gip/provider/

Now you can see the results on MDS (/etc/init.d/globus-mds start).
