/**
 * CDCThreadFactory decorates another ThreadFactory and makes all
 * threads CDC aware. Each thread gets initialized with a CDC binding
 * the thread to a particular cell.
 *
 * This thread factory is intended for use with thread pools. For thread
 * pools it doesn't make sense to maintain the calling CDC at the thread
 * level. Only the cell is common to all threads. More detailed context
 * information has to be set per job.
 *
 * Note that CellNucleus itself is a thread factory and initializes threads
 * in this way already. There is no reason to wrap the CellNucleus with
 * CDCThreadFactory.
